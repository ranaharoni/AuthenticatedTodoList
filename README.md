# Authenticated To-do List

This application is the next big thing. Think of it as a Tesla car, but without the wheels, motors or seats; Because an app with seats would be silly, wouldn't it? Wait! WoaH! That might be a interesting feature, like the next big thing after "the next big thing". Something like the next big big thing, or the next bigger thing. Nevermind, lets focus on the MVP.

So going back to what's important and this time lets cut to the point. It's an app for those moments when you need to murder those items on your checklist.
